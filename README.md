# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 👋

Hi there! My name is **Imran Hosen**, and I'm currently a BSc Physics student with an immense passion for coding and technology. From the moment I started learning coding in 10th grade with basic concepts like loops and conditions, I was captivated by the endless possibilities that technology offers. 🚀

### What I'm Learning 🧠

I am diving into **C programming** and have an ambitious plan to explore a wide range of programming languages. My curiosity about how technology shapes our world drives me to continuously expand my knowledge, particularly in the **Linux environment** and other coding practices.

### Goals 🎯

**Short-term:** Deepen my understanding of the Linux environment and continue advancing my coding skills. Each new concept excites me as I uncover more about the world of technology.

**Long-term:** My ultimate goal is to become a **cyber specialist** or work in **cybersecurity**. The intersection of **AI** and **computer science** fascinates me, and I aim to make impactful contributions in these fields, leveraging my passion for solving complex problems and innovating.

### Hobbies and Interests 🎮📚✈️

Outside of coding, I immerse myself in **playing online games**, **reading thought-provoking books**, and **traveling** to gain new perspectives. These interests not only provide balance but also inspire and enrich my journey in technology.

### GitHub Purpose 💻

This GitHub account is my playground for showcasing my projects, whether small or large. It's a space where I can document my progress, share my work, and learn from the broader coding community. My fascination with coding drives me to constantly build, experiment, and improve.
